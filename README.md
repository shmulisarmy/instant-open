# Instant Open

A powerful keyboard shortcut utility that allows you to quickly open applications and websites using custom key sequences. This tool helps streamline your workflow by reducing the time spent navigating to frequently used applications and websites.

## Features

- **Quick Application Launch**: Open applications with custom key sequences
- **Website Shortcuts**: Instantly navigate to frequently visited websites
- **Smart Typing Detection**: Automatically detects when you're in "typing mode" (based on your typing speed) to prevent accidental triggers
- **Customizable**: Easy to configure through `user_settings.json`
- **Mouse Position Control**: Optional extension for mouse position control

## Installation

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shmulisarmy/instant-open.git
mv instant-open ~/desktop
```
Simply launch the `instant-open` executable from your desktop to start using the tool. 
(For now, you'll need to launch it manually when you start your computer.) automatic run on startup coming soon...

### Compile The Program Yourself

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `go mod download` to install dependencies
4. Build the project with `go build`
5. Run the executable: `./instant-open`

## Configuration

The tool is configured through `user_settings.json`. Here's how to customize it:

### Application Shortcuts

Configure application shortcuts in the `application_map` section:

```json
"application_map": {
    "t": "Trello", //hold down o+a+t to open Trello app 
    "f": "Firefox", //same idea 
    "v": "Voice Memo"   
    // Add more applications as needed
}
```

### Website Shortcuts

Configure website shortcuts in the `site_map` section:

```json
"site_map": {
    "g": "github.com/", //hold down o+s+g to open github.com site
    "y": "youtube.com", //same idea
    "t": "typingclub.com"
    // Add more websites as needed
}
```

### Additional Settings

- `typing_speed`: Set to "fast" or "slow" to adjust the typing detection sensitivity
  - "fast": More lenient detection, better for quick typists
  - "slow": Stricter detection, better for slower typists
- `extensions`: Enable additional features like "mtl" (move to top-left)

## Usage

### Application Shortcuts
- Hold down `o`, `a`, and the configured letter simultaneously to open an application
- Example: Hold `o`+`a`+`t` together to open Trello

### Website Shortcuts
- Hold down `o`, `s`, and the configured letter simultaneously to open a website
- Example: Hold `o`+`s`+`g` together to open GitHub

### Mouse Control
- If enabled, use the `mtl` sequence to move the mouse to the top-left of the current window

### Typing Mode Detection
The tool automatically detects when you're typing normally and won't trigger shortcuts during typing. This is based on:
- The speed between key presses
- The `typing_speed` setting in your configuration
- A lookback window of the last few keystrokes

## How It Works

The tool monitors keyboard input and detects specific key sequences. When a sequence is recognized:
1. It checks if you're in typing mode (to prevent accidental triggers)
2. If not typing, it executes the corresponding action
3. Any typed characters from the sequence are automatically removed
