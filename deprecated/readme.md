this is from when you would add o in the json file so that when you don't include the 'o' you can add numbers have multiple sites and applications to be opened with a letter (you'd just use the a number for each one instead of an 'o'), you can still have multiple that go with a letter eg: s: ["spotify.com", "stackoverflow.com"] but now if you do that all the numbered ones will required 4 keys and you achieve this by just putting 2 letters by the key eg:{ "s1": "spotify.com", "s2": "stackoverflow.com", }
